FrontEnd Developer,Developer,"Front-end developers use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the client side of a website.","A front end developer reads a design file and creates a plan to turn that design into valid HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. A web browser then renders this code when you go to a site. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three core languages used to build the front end of a website.","Front end web developers spend their days translating designs into code. They get to know the inner workings behind a site’s design. They then use this knowledge to build a functional and aesthetically pleasing experience.

For developers who enjoy creative work, front end web development could be an excellent career. Not only will you code other people’s designs but you’ll also have some say in the overall creative direction of a website.

If you are more interested in the “brains” behind a website, then back end or full stack web development may be for you. Whatever you choose, one thing is for sure—careers in web development all afford lucrative salaries, great career prospects, and unique responsibilities.","Front-End Developer, Website Developer, Full Stack Developer, Front End Engineer, Software Engineer",100200,8%
BackEnd Developer,Developer,A back-end web developer is responsible for server-side web application logic and integration of the work front-end web developers do.,"In short, the back end is all of the software that runs on the server, and it’s the backbone that makes the front end functional. While some sites, typically called static sites, only really have a front end, any site with dynamic content wouldn’t work without a back end supporting it.

They maintain core databases, manage application program interfaces (APIs), as well as test and debug back end processes to ensure that a program functions smoothly and effectively at all times.","If you are more interested in the “brains” behind a website, then back end development may be for you. You will spend your days building algorithms to make informed decisions, spend a lot of time on coding challenges and working with more complex programming languages.

You will also be involved with the behind-the-scenes architecture of the website, often working with different programming languages and frameworks dependent on the company.","Back-End Developer, Website Developer, Full Stack Developer, Back End Engineer, Software Engineer",116000,7%
FullStack Developer,Developer,"Builds, troubleshoots, and mantains software applications","A fullstack developer is an expert in both front end and back end development. That is, these devs have a keen understanding of both “stacks.” A software stack is simply a collection of different technologies that developers use to accomplish certain goals.

These developers can create the interactive elements of a website, the same way front end developers can. They can also develop websites and applications on the server-side, as well as work with databases.

Most fullstack developers specialise in either frontend or backend as they move from a junior role or internship to a mid-level role.","A good way to think of full-stack web developers is as a Swiss Army knife. They have a lot of varying skills. Full-stack web developers do not specialize in a particular language. They get to know all of the technologies behind a web application.

Full-stack web development is the glue between the front-end and the back-end. They help bridge the gap between client and server software to make a web application run as intended.

To be a good full-stack web developer, you need to have an  understanding of programming a browser, a back-end application, and a  database where data is stored.

Most full-stack developers are employed on mid-to-large teams. This  is because there is a greater need for people who focus all their time  on a particular topic. With that said, some smaller teams may have  full-stack web developers.

You can expect to use your full-stack web development skills in some  of your web projects. Say, for instance, you want to build a to-do list front-end app. You may decide to write a back-end app to store data.  Such a project involves working with the front-end, back-end, and a database.","Application Developer, Cloud Application Developer, Junior Full-Stack Cloud Native Application Developer, Full-Stack Cloud Native Application Developer",100900,22%
Data Scientist,Data,A data scientist turns raw data into valuable insights that an organisation needs in order to grow and compete. They interpret and analyse data from multiple sources to come up with imaginative solutions to problems.,"Data scientists utilize their analytical, statistical, and programming skills to collect, analyze, and interpret large data sets. They then use this information to develop data-driven solutions to  business challenges.

A Data Scientist is a senior role and usually leads a team of Data Analysts and Engineers. They have a wide range of technical competencies including: statistics and machine learning, coding languages, databases, machine learning, and reporting technologies.

The data scientist may also build the algorithm that's fed into a ML/DL model, working with a Data Engineer to ensure that the pipeline is set up correctly.","A Data Scientist is the captain of the data team and has a strong understanding of all areas of data: programming, architecture, modelling, analysis. At the same time, they also have a good business brain and know how to deal with key stakeholders at a management level.

As a result, a Data Scientist has a senior role. They should have experience in programming, business and have worked with large data sets before.","Data Scientist, Business Intelligence Analyst, Data Analyst, Data Architect, Data Engineer, Marketing Analyst, Operations Analyst, Quantitative Analyst",112400,36%

It is a management role with little executional work directly impacting the product. Most PMs do not code, dictate business growth or create brand and design. Instead, they are the magician that brings together all three parts of the business into a useable and effective product.

Two key characteristics of a PM are: creativity and user-centricity. They should be creative in thinking of solutions as well as obsessed with quantitative and qualitative feedback from users.

Many PMs go on to become founders in the long run. It is actually the best entrance route to becoming a founder of a startup, as you then start to have real empathy with the user.","Associate Product Manager, Product Manager, Senior Product Manager, VP of Product, Chief of Product",110900,32%
