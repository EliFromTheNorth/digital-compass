It is a rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), as the final project of our 4-people team at [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) in Bali, batch #1066.

It was conceived as part of the project [she explores tech](https://www.sheexplores.tech), which is in a mission to increase diversity in Tech in Switzerland. By using tools powered by artificial intelligence and harnessing the power of mentorship and community, we empower women with career exploration, reskilling and job placement.
